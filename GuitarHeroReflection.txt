Assessment 2: GuitarHero Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned about a particular practical application
of the queue data structure, that is, the representation
of a ring buffer used to model the oscillation displacements of a guitar.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggled most with unlearning bad habits when
coding, as my old coding style of explicitly
specifying classes to import caused the online judge
on EdStem to grade my assignment erroneously, and this
was only resolved when, in accordance with the style guide 
on the CSE 143 website, I replaced my specific class 
imports with a wildcard import.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will pay further attention to my code style and make sure
it adheres to the CSE 143 style guide guidelines.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

N/A, the specification itself was sufficiently clear.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

I spent approximately 1-2 hours on the assignment.
