Assessment 1: LetterInventory Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned about proper coding style conventions,
such as line length, documentation through
comments, and what Java coding habits I should avoid 
(by referencing the CSE143 code quality guide).

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggled most with having to unlearn previous
coding habits I picked up, some of which were
disallowed according to the UW CSE143 code-quality
guide, such as using return on void methods. As
such I had to consciously recognize unconscious bad habits.
Another bad habit I am unlearning is insufficient code 
documentation, as I had to write comments to document the
behaviour and results of the functions of the LetterInventory
class.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will be more conscious of bad coding conventions I make
and make efforts to avoid them. I will also proactively
leave helpful comments on my code to aid others in
understanding how my code works.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

No parts of the specification or requirements were
unclear. 

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

I spent about 1 hour working on this assignment.
