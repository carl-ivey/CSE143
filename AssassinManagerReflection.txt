Assessment 3: AssassinManager Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned about the applications of linkedlist
data structures such as how the killer hierarchy
in the "assassin" game can be represented with
list nodes.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggled most with maintaining good code
style, and I worked to overcome this struggle
by checking whether my code complies with the
CSE 143 style guide each time after I write
a function.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will continue checking whether my code
complies with the CSE 143 style guide each time 
after I write a function.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

N/A - all parts of the specification and 
requirements were sufficiently clear.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

Estimate: 1 hour
