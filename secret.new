'Cause tonight, we're counting down, come and give me your hand
Time for our revolution!
Come on let's get furry!

Show your teeth and work that beat tonight
With our paws to the walls
Crank the power. This is the hour tonight
With our paws to the walls
You can do whatever the fuck you like
With our paws to the walls
You
Anthropomorphical
And me
With our paws to the walls

Milo
Let's get outta this bar
Your blue and your black and your white turn me on
Milo
We be thinking alike
Keep up this drinking and find us a club tonight
So you say your name's Milo?
Baby well I know just how a tiger gets down
All ya need's this akita, some bass underneath, and our paws to the walls!

Show me what your paws can handle
Make me your scandal
Love below the waist. Let's finish the chase!
Work your moves on this akita
I'll make you a believer
'Cause the only truth to my name is that Niic, guys, finish last!
Last, like the bottles we'll never run out of
'Cause this party runs every city and town
And I'm wearing the crown to this fur underground
So yeah don't tread on me
Keep your hands on my waist like you're paying my price
And it's you and me till the gun powder ignites
There's no ending in sight like one thousand one nights
So let's go all night, night

'Cause tonight, we're counting down, come and give me your hand
Time for our revolution!
Come on let's get furry!

Show your teeth and work that beat tonight
With our paws to the walls
Crank the power. This is the hour tonight
With our paws to the walls
You can have whatever the fuck you like
With our paws to the walls
You and me
Anthropomorphical
With our paws to the walls

Milo tell me you're the one
Who will take me high as the sun
When this night's over and done
There won't be anyone
Just you and me, and our paws to the walls
Of all of the furs I could take home with me
There's something that gets me bout a pantayrah teegrees
