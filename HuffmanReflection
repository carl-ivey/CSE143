Assesement 8: HuffmanCode Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned about the application of binary trees 
and priority queue algorithms to lossless
file compression using Huffman compression.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggled most with ensuring my data worked
with all data sets, and I worked to overcome this
struggle by tracing my code and debugging it by
printing the huffman tree structure.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will methodically debug my code more using
my IDE's debugger

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

N/A

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

around 3-4 hours
