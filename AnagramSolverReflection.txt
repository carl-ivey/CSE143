Assesement 6: AnagramSolver Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned about practical applications of recursive
backtracking from workign on this assignment.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggled most with the backtracking part of
recursive backtracking as you have to "undo"
the changes made to the current working order
after the recursion has ended.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will use my improved understanding of recursive
backtracking to complete future assignments faster.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

N/A, specifications and requirements were
sufficiently clear.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

1.5 hours
